# Roadmap & Future Considerations — Python Mock OIDC

What's not yet shipped, what's worth doing next, and what's parked unless a
specific need surfaces.

Current release is **v0.5.1**. The v0.3 surface is documented in ADR-002 and
ADR-003. The v0.4 surface is documented in ADR-003 (Postgres backend) and the
commit history. The v0.5 surface is documented in ADR-004 (per-issuer signing
keys) and the commit history.

---

## Status legend

- 🟢 **v0.4 candidate** — meaningful next step; build when a real test demands it
- 🟡 **Parked** — useful but no concrete demand yet; revisit when one shows up
- 🔴 **Maybe-never** — build only if a concrete and well-scoped use case appears

---

## v0.5 candidates

Items are grouped by theme. Within each group, higher entries are higher
priority based on effort-to-value ratio.

### Backend / persistence

#### 🟢 Secret management (`from_env` / `from_file`)

Load passwords, client secrets, and the admin token from environment
variables or mounted files instead of plain text in the YAML config.

**Why:** plain-text secrets in a ConfigMap are acceptable for a test
fixture but problematic in environments with secret-scanning CI checks
or stricter compliance posture. Kubernetes Secrets mounted at a path is
the zero-dependency solution.

**Shape:**

```yaml
service_principals:
  service-a:
    secret:
      from_env: MOCK_IDP_SERVICE_A_SECRET   # reads os.environ
      # or:
      from_file: /var/run/secrets/service-a  # reads file contents (trimmed)
```

**Effort:** ~30 LOC; resolved in `YamlIdentityStore._apply()` before the
Pydantic model is populated. No new dependencies needed for env/file;
`hvac` optional for Vault (separate item below).

#### 🟡 Secret management (Vault)

Pull secrets from HashiCorp Vault at startup. Config references a path
(`vault://secret/mock-idp/clients`). Requires `hvac` as an optional
dependency.

**When to revisit:** when a team using Vault wants to avoid duplicating
secrets into a ConfigMap.

---

### Protocol surface

---

### Token fidelity

#### 🟢 Realm roles (Keycloak-influenced, optional)

Tenant-level role assignments for directory-scoped roles (e.g.
`Global.Reader`) that appear in every token regardless of audience.
Merged alongside resource-scoped grants from the clients block.

**Why:** closer to real directory models where some roles are
tenant-wide, not per-resource. Deferred from v0.3 — no concrete test
demand yet. Shape and merge logic are documented in ADR-002 §Decision.

**Effort:** ~20 LOC.

---

### Observability / testing

#### 🟢 Webhook on token issuance

Configurable URL the mock POSTs to on every successful token issuance,
with the request parameters and token claims. Lets integration tests
assert "what was issued" without scraping logs.

```yaml
webhooks:
  - url: http://test-recorder.example.com/events
    events: [token_issued]
```

**Effort:** ~30 LOC + tests; `httpx` async client (already a dev
dependency via `starlette`'s test client).

---

## Parked

### 🟡 ID token issuance (`id_token` alongside `access_token`)

Token endpoint returns both an `access_token` and a separate `id_token`
when scope includes `openid`.

**Why parked:** API gateway OIDC plugins primarily validate access
tokens. ID tokens matter for browser-based OIDC login flows — most
gateway plugin tests don't exercise them.

**When to revisit:** if you start testing browser-based OIDC login flows
where the post-auth redirect carries the ID token.

### 🟡 Authorization Code grant (RFC 6749 §4.1)

`GET /{issuer}/authorize` with redirect handling, PKCE,
`response_type=code`, then code exchange at `/token`.

**Why parked:** complex (state/nonce tracking, PKCE verification,
redirect URI matching). Not needed for service-to-service or ROPC flows.

**When to revisit:** if you start testing interactive web login paths
end-to-end.

### 🟡 Device Code grant (RFC 8628)

CLI-style: device polls, user authorizes in a browser. Niche.

**When to revisit:** if you're explicitly testing device-code clients.

### 🟡 Token revocation (RFC 7009)

`POST /revoke` lets a client tell the identity provider "invalidate this
token." The mock would track revoked tokens and reject them on
introspection / userinfo.

**Why parked:** revocation matters mostly when paired with introspection.
If using JWT-validation-only (which most gateway OIDC plugins do),
revocation doesn't bite — tokens are valid until `exp`.

**When to revisit:** once token introspection lands; revocation without
introspection has limited test value.

### 🟡 OIDC end-session endpoint

`GET /{issuer}/logout` — the OIDC logout flow.

**When to revisit:** if the gateway starts mediating logout flows.

### 🟡 Client assertion auth (private_key_jwt, client_secret_jwt)

Instead of `client_secret`, the client signs a JWT proving its identity.
RFC 7521 / RFC 7523.

**Why parked:** most M2M flows still use `client_secret`. Real test
value is limited.

**When to revisit:** if you start using cert-based client auth in
production.

### 🟡 Configurable Cache-Control on JWKS and discovery

Lets you simulate "JWKS cached for 1 second" or "JWKS cached for an
hour" to test the gateway's cache behavior independently.

**When to revisit:** if cache-related bugs start showing up in gateway
JWKS handling.

### 🟡 Webhook delivery retries / dead-letter

If webhooks land (see v0.4 candidates), eventually they fail.
Production-grade behavior: retry, then DLQ.

**When to revisit:** when webhook reliability becomes a real concern.

---

## Maybe-never (concrete use case required)

### 🔴 Sample artifact generators

- `GET /debug/postman.json` — Postman collection
- `GET /debug/insomnia.json` — Insomnia workspace
- `GET /debug/curl-examples.sh` — bash script of every example

Cute. But each one is a maintenance liability if the underlying surface
changes. Build only if the onboarding pain is real.

### 🔴 Browser-based admin UI for editing identities

A web form for adding/editing users at runtime without editing YAML.

**Why maybe-never:** YAML editing + hot-reload is now zero-friction. A
UI doubles the surface area and adds an actual auth-and-authz problem to
solve.

### 🔴 Multi-tenant simulation with separate user pools per issuer

Each issuer path has a different `USERS` dict, modeling separate tenants
with non-overlapping identities.

**Why maybe-never:** the current model (one config, all users accessible
at any issuer) is fine for almost every test. If you need strict tenant
isolation, run multiple mock pods with separate configs — that's both
simpler and more realistic.

### 🔴 Prometheus / OTel metrics

`fastapi-instrumentator` makes this a one-import. Useful for production
observability, less useful for a test fixture without a SLO.

**Why maybe-never:** "scrape access logs" is sufficient. Don't over-build
observability for a test tool.

### 🔴 Persistent revoked-tokens / persistent issued-tokens

Store issued tokens for replay-attack testing. Track revoked tokens
across pod restarts.

**Why maybe-never:** persistence drags in real ops concerns. For a test
fixture, fresh-start-per-restart is ideal. The Postgres backend (v0.4)
makes this possible if the need ever becomes concrete.

## Resolved

### v0.5

- ✓ **Configurable signing algorithm per identity (v0.5.1)** — `signing_alg: RS256`
  (default) or `signing_alg: ES256` on any user or service principal. Each issuer
  now also holds an EC P-256 keypair alongside the RSA-2048 pair; JWKS publishes
  both signing keys (4 keys total: RSA signing, EC signing, 2 RSA decoys). `sign()`
  auto-detects the algorithm from the key type. Discovery advertises
  `["RS256", "ES256"]`. `config.example.yaml` sets `service-b` to ES256. 5 new tests.
  See S67–S71 in test-scenarios.md.
- ✓ **Per-issuer signing keys (v0.5.0)** — each issuer path now has its own RSA-2048
  keypair (signing + unpublished alt + 2 decoys), created lazily on first use.
  `/{issuer}/jwks` returns only that issuer's keys. `POST /admin/rotate-jwks?issuer=<slug>`
  rotates one issuer; omitting `?issuer=` rotates all known issuers. `/debug/config`
  returns `signing_kids: {issuer: kid}` dict. 3 new isolation tests (distinct kids,
  cross-issuer verify fails, single-issuer rotate leaves others untouched). See ADR-004.

### v0.4

- ✓ **v0.4.3 patch** — `verify_token()` helper in `tokens.py` was accidentally left
  unstaged when v0.4.2 was committed; the tagged image failed on startup with
  `ImportError`. OS-level Trivy CVEs resolved by adding `apt-get upgrade` to the
  Dockerfile. Dependabot added for weekly Python and GitHub Actions updates. Trivy SARIF
  results now uploaded to the GitHub Security tab.
- ✓ **Postgres backend (`PostgresIdentityStore`, v0.4.0)** — `asyncpg`-backed store behind
  the `IdentityStore` protocol. `MOCK_IDP_BACKEND=postgres` + `MOCK_IDP_PG_DSN` selects it.
  Schema managed by Alembic (`alembic upgrade head`). `startup()`/`shutdown()` lifecycle
  methods for pool management. `POST /admin/reload-config` triggers reload on all backends.
  `IdentityStore.reload()` is now `async`; `startup`/`shutdown` added to the protocol.
  Optional deps: `asyncpg`, `sqlalchemy[asyncio]`, `alembic` (install with
  `uv sync --extra postgres`). See ADR-003 §Adding a new backend.
- ✓ **Token introspection (RFC 7662, v0.4.1)** — `POST /{issuer}/introspect`. Caller
  authenticates with `client_id` + `client_secret` (service principal). Returns
  `{"active": true, ...claims}` for a valid non-expired token, `{"active": false}` for
  anything else. Discovery doc advertises `introspection_endpoint`. 8 new tests.
- ✓ **OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange (RFC 8693, v0.4.2)** — new `token-exchange` grant type on
  `POST /{issuer}/token`. Intermediary authenticates, inbound `subject_token` is verified
  (signature + expiry). Outbound token preserves `sub`, `oid`, `tid`, `preferred_username`
  from the inbound token; adds `act = {"sub": intermediary}`. Roles resolved for the
  intermediary against the requested audience. Response includes `issued_token_type`. 8 new
  tests. Discovery `grant_types_supported` updated.

### v0.3

- ✓ **Tenant-keyed config schema (v0.2)** — `tid` hoisted from individual identity
  records to the grouping key. `users:` and `clients:` nest under
  `tenants: {<tid>: {...}}`. Eliminates repeated `tid` on every record.
- ✓ **Provider plugin architecture (v0.3)** — `providers/` module; dispatch by `provider:`
  field on `TenantRecord` (default `entra_id`). Claim-shape emulation only. See ADR-002.
- ✓ **Entra ID rich grants model (v0.3)** — `service_principals:` for machine identities,
  `clients:` for resource apps with `grants:` per identity. `resolve_roles()` uses grants
  table when a `ClientAppRecord` exists; falls back to flat `roles` otherwise.
- ✓ **Feature gates are implicit (v0.3)** — presence of `clients:` grants block activates
  grants model; no explicit `features:` flag.
- ✓ **Playground update (v0.3.1)** — audience dropdown from `client_apps`,
  `service_principals` identity group, resolved-roles display per audience.
- ✓ **Playground testing overrides + sig verification (v0.3.2)** — collapsible
  "Testing overrides" panel; signature verification badge via `POST /debug/decode`.
- ✓ **Admin `iss` override (v0.3.3)** — `override_iss_too: true` flag on an admin SP.
- ✓ **Slow / failing endpoints (v0.3.4)** — `X-Test-Delay-Ms` and `X-Test-Fail` headers.
- ✓ **Multi-key JWKS (v0.3.5)** — 3 keys: 1 active + 2 decoys. Tests kid-based selection.
- ✓ **Per-issuer `auth_mode` (v0.3.6)** — `issuer_modes: {slug: lax|strict}` in config.
- ✓ **Algorithm-failure negative endpoints (v0.3.7)** — `token/unsigned` (alg:none) and
  `token/wrong-alg` (HS256 confusion). Playground Token variant selector.
- ✓ **Config pre-lint and better validation errors (v0.3.8)** — structural lint, difflib
  "did you mean?" suggestions, `extra='forbid'` on `AppConfig` and `TenantRecord`.
- ✓ **Pluggable identity store + config hot-reload (v0.3.9)** — `IdentityStore` protocol,
  `YamlIdentityStore`, `create_store()` factory, `watchfiles` file watcher. ConfigMap
  remounts picked up with no pod restart. See ADR-003.

### v0.2 (historical)

- ✓ Password grant `client_id` optional.
- ✓ `resource` and `scope` both accepted; `resource` wins; `/.default` stripped.
- ✓ Default `aud` = `api://default`.
- ✓ Lax / strict audience gating; per-identity `allowed_audiences`.
- ✓ Token shape resolution: header > suffix > config > v2.
- ✓ Mnemonic identity aliases via `client_id` field.
- ✓ Per-identity `token_lifetime_seconds`.
- ✓ `extra_claims` merged verbatim into the token.
- ✓ Admin claim override (`override_any_claim: true`).
- ✓ Admin key rotation (`POST /admin/rotate-jwks`).
- ✓ Token playground (`GET /`).
- ✓ Debug endpoints (`/debug/decode`, `/debug/identities`, `/debug/config`).
- ✓ CORS middleware; `cors_allow_origins` configurable.

## Process notes

- Every roadmap item should land with: code, tests, a test-scenario doc
  entry, and a config schema update if applicable.
- Pull items in one at a time based on what tests actually demand.
- If a parked item becomes a candidate, move it up (not delete and re-add)
  so the discussion history is preserved.
- If a maybe-never item gets a concrete use case, write the use case
  down here before reclassifying.
